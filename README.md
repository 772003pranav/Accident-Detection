## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This AI-powered accident detection system uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models** to identify **vehicle collisions in real-time** from video footage. The system then:  
✅ Calculates the **severity** of the accident.  
✅ Retrieves **real-time weather conditions**.  
✅ Identifies the **nearest police station & hospital**.  
✅ Sends **emergency alerts** via **email** with an attached accident report, images, and video clips.  

> 🔥 **Goal:** To improve emergency response time and reduce accident-related fatalities.

## 🛠 **Features**  
✅ **Real-Time Accident Detection** - Uses YOLO object detection to monitor collisions.  
✅ **Severity Estimation** - Calculates accident impact based on speed, IoU (Intersection over Union), and vehicle movement.  
✅ **Weather Integration** - Fetches live weather data for better accident context.  
✅ **Automated Emergency Alerts** - Sends an **email** with accident details to emergency contacts.  
✅ **Location-Based Response** - Uses **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** to find the nearest police & hospital.  
✅ **Flask API** - Accepts video input via an API endpoint.  
✅ **Dynamic Model Selection** - Selects **YOLOv11n, YOLOv11s, or YOLOv11m** based on system memory.

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The accident detection system is trained and tested using:  

1️⃣ **COCO (Common Objects in Context) Dataset** – Includes various vehicle types in different environments.  
2️⃣ **Real-Time Accident Videos** – Collected from dashcams, CCTV footage, and accident scenario datasets.  
3️⃣ **Weather-Adaptive Datasets** – Videos in rain, fog, and low-light conditions to test robustness.

## 🚀 **Running the System**  
1️⃣ Start the Flask Server
bash
Copy
python detection.py
Flask API will start on: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

2️⃣ Send a Video File for Accident Detection
Use Postman or cURL to test the API:

bash
Copy
curl -X POST -F "video=@test-video.mp4" http://127.0.0.1:5000/detect
🖥️ After processing, an email alert will be sent automatically!
