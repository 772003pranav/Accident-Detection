## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This AI-powered accident detection system uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models** to identify **vehicle collisions in real-time** from video footage. The system then:  
✅ Calculates the **severity** of the accident using speed, IoU, and collision impact.  
✅ Retrieves **real-time weather conditions** to assess accident risks.  
✅ Identifies the **nearest police station & hospital** for emergency response.  
✅ Sends **emergency alerts** via **email & SMS** with an attached accident report, images, and video clips.  
✅ Extracts **vehicle number plate using OCR** for insurance and medical processing.  
✅ Automates **insurance claim submission** based on accident damage assessment.  
✅ Notifies **insurance policyholder & nominees** about the accident for immediate action.  
✅ Sends **organ donation alerts** to family members in case of brain death.  
✅ Sends **blood donation requests** to nominees in case of severe blood loss to save time.  
✅ Uses **AI-powered damage estimation** to assist in automatic claim processing.  

> 🔥 **Goal:** To improve emergency response time and reduce accident-related fatalities.

pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Download YOLO Model Files
Download the YOLO weight files and place them inside the models/ folder.

bash

mkdir models
cd models
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8/yolov8n.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8/yolov8s.pt
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8/yolov8m.pt
cd ..
4️⃣ Set Up API Keys
Create a config.py or .env file to store sensitive information:

python

SENDER_EMAIL = "your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
WEATHER_API_KEY = "your-weather-api-key"
⚠️ Important: Never share your API keys! Always add config.py or .env to .gitignore before pushing to GitHub.
